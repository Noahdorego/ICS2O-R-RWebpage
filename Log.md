Things I have learned:
In this activity, I have learned about input devices and website making. I have learned that input
devices send data to a computer, such as a keyboard or mouse. They can be wired or wireless. The 
opposite are output devices; they receive data from the computer. Some devices can act as both
input and output devices (ex. a USB.).

I've learned how to make and format simple websites, add borders, add images, etc.In the gallery walk,
I learned about many other systems such as RAM and ROM, Mobile Operating Systems, Output devices, and more.

Things I still want to learn:

I still want to expand my learning about internal components of these devices, and exactly what
makes them work. I also want to improve my CSS skills. I also want to learn more about computer 
efficiency, and how each component helps.
